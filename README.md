## Statement of need

`graph-pes` is a toolkit for building, training, and deploying machine-learned potential energy surfaces (PES) models that act on graph representations of atomic structures.

As a researcher who wants to train and use existing MLIPs, you can use the `graph-pes-train` command to train many different architectures from scratch on your own data, or fine-tune several existing foundation models. Once trained, you can use our drivers to run optimisations, single point energy calculations, and molecular dynamics simulations with your model with a variety of existing tools (`LAMMPS`, `ASE`, and `torch-sim`).

As a researcher wanting to work on MLIP methodology, `graph-pes` makes implementing new architectures easy, allows you to experiment with various different training strategies, and provides a clean, well-documented API for building things yourself.


## Features

- Experiment with new model architectures by inheriting from our `GraphPESModel` [base class](https://vldgroup.github.io/graph-pes/models/root.html).
- [Train your own](https://vldgroup.github.io/graph-pes/quickstart/implement-a-model.html) or existing model architectures (e.g., [SchNet](https://vldgroup.github.io/graph-pes/models/many-body/schnet.html), [NequIP](https://vldgroup.github.io/graph-pes/models/many-body/nequip.html), [PaiNN](https://vldgroup.github.io/graph-pes/models/many-body/painn.html), [MACE](https://vldgroup.github.io/graph-pes/models/many-body/mace.html), [TensorNet](https://vldgroup.github.io/graph-pes/models/many-body/tensornet.html), [OrB](https://vldgroup.github.io/graph-pes/models/many-body/orb.html) etc.).
- Use and fine-tune foundation models via a unified interface: [MACE-MP0](https://vldgroup.github.io/graph-pes/interfaces/mace.html), [MACE-OFF](https://vldgroup.github.io/graph-pes/interfaces/mace.html), [MatterSim](https://vldgroup.github.io/graph-pes/interfaces/mattersim.html), [GO-MACE](https://vldgroup.github.io/graph-pes/interfaces/mace.html), [Egret](https://vldgroup.github.io/graph-pes/interfaces/mace.html#graph_pes.interfaces.egret) and [Orb v2/3](https://vldgroup.github.io/graph-pes/interfaces/orb.html).
- Easily configure distributed training, learning rate scheduling, weights and biases logging, and other features using our `graph-pes-train` [command line interface](https://vldgroup.github.io/graph-pes/cli/graph-pes-train/root.html).
- Use our data-loading pipeline within your [own training loop](https://vldgroup.github.io/graph-pes/quickstart/custom-training-loop.html).
- Run molecular dynamics simulations with any `GraphPESModel` using [torch-sim](https://vldgroup.github.io/graph-pes/tools/torch-sim.html), [LAMMPS](https://vldgroup.github.io/graph-pes/tools/lammps.html) or [ASE](https://vldgroup.github.io/graph-pes/tools/ase.html)
